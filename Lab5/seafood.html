        <h3><a href="http://fishmongersplano.com/">Fishmonger's</a></h3>
        <p></p>
        <p>This restaurant has been a family favorite since they opened in 1981. I have fond memories of dining there when my kids were young. They have moved several times, but the food has remained excellent. Their bread pudding is to “die for”. It is that good!</p>

        <h3><a href="http://fishshackplano.com/index.htm">Fish Shack</a></h3>
        <p>This restaurant is a neighborhood favorite. Or group gets together every week or so and the Fish Shack is always on the list of possible sites. I usually get the blackened fish special.</p>

          <h3><a href="https://www.flyingfishinthe.net/location?l=Plano">Flying Fish</a></h3>
          <p>This restaurant is another neighborhood favorite. They often have “buy one meal & get the second free” coupons. And the food is particularly good. Again – I like the blackened fish entrees.  The atmosphere and service is also excellent. A fun place to visit!</p>

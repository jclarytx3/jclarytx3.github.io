        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p></p>
        <p>I enjoy many food types. Two of my favorites are Korean barbeque and Seafood. I also enjoy salads, and Texas
          barbeque.</p>
        <p>
          Please visit my <a href="kb.html">Korean Barbeque page</a> and my <a href="seafood.html">Seafood page</a>for
          more details and my favorite restaurants.</p>

        <h3><a href="kb.html">Why Korean Barbeque?</a></h3>
        <p>Now it may appear “strange” that a Texan would love Korean Barbeque. One again – the answer is simple. I
          developed a love for seafood while in Hawaii. I spent over 25 years traveling to Hawaii every other week to
          visit a major client. I learned to love the food at the take-out place at the Ala Moana mall. I’d stop by
          there often to get my barbeque fix.</p>

        <h3><a href="seafood.html">Why Seafood?</a></h3>
        <p>A reasonable question might be “why is seafood one of his favorite foods?” Well – the answer is simple. I
          developed a love for seafood as a kid living on Key Biscayne (part of Miami). The only “real” non-hotel
          restaurant at that time was a seafood place with a pirate theme. S, it was either learn to appreciate seafood
          or go hungry.</p>
